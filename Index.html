        		<h1>Hi there, I'm John Robinson</h1>
            <p>I've been blogging at soreeyes.org for years now, but for the time being most of that old content is offline. I've been using Jekyll to manage my content lately, but in the wake of problems with my Mac Mini I've been without a machine to run Jekyll on since late November 2017 and consequently I'm currently exploring my options for hosting at least my new content at GitHub.</p>
            <p>As of right now (the evening of Sunday 4 February 2018) I've got as far as starting to do the requisite setup within GitHub that should allow me to both move my last several months of blog entries into GitHub's setup so I can use their variant of Jekyll to maintain that content.</p>
            <p>So, for now, all I can say is watch this space for further developments...</p>
